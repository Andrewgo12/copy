## üîç Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators

- **Use strong passwords** - Minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
- **Enable 2FA** - Two-factor authentication for all admin accounts
- **Regular updates** - Keep the system updated with latest security patches
- **Monitor logs** - Review security logs regularly
- **Backup data** - Regular encrypted backups
- **Network security** - Use HTTPS and secure network configurations

### For Developers

- **Secure coding** - Follow OWASP guidelines
- **Dependency updates** - Keep dependencies updated
- **Code reviews** - Security-focused code reviews
- **Testing** - Include security testing in CI/CD
- **Environment separation** - Separate dev/staging/production environments

### For End Users

- **Strong passwords** - Use unique, strong passwords
- **Enable 2FA** - Two-factor authentication when available
- **Logout properly** - Always logout when finished
- **Report issues** - Report suspicious activity
- **Keep browsers updated** - Use latest browser versions

## üîß Security Configuration

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Environment variables for production
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-secret-key
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000  # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100        # requests per window
```

### Security Headers

The application automatically sets these security headers:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### HTTPS Configuration

For production deployment, ensure HTTPS is enabled:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512;
}
```
