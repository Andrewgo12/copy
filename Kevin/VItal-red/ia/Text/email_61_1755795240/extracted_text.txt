Hello,

Please be aware that free trial accounts for the Cloud Platform have 
limited Compute Engine quota during their trial period.

We understand you'd like to have more quota; that's great! We'd love to 
help you with that. Before we can move further, you'll need to upgrade to a 
paid account, because the trial accounts have a hard limit on quota [1]. To 
do so, please follow these quick steps:

Login as Owner to your Google Developers Console at 
http://cloud.google.com/ Click 'Upgrade my account' from the top of any 
page once logged in to your Console.
Voila! It's done. You've just been upgraded to a paid account.
You should now benefit from the upgraded free resource/courtesy quotas!
For more details on the default resource quotas provided with paid accounts,
please refer to our Compute Engine Resource Quotas documentation [2]. If 
you need more quotas beyond the aforementioned, you can always submit 
another quota increase request on the bottom of the latter page.

I truly hope this information was helpful. Feel free to let us know if you 
require further assistance or have further questions in this regard.

Have a nice day!

Sincerely,
Google Cloud Support
